This lab project has been led by a group of PoliMi students for the Geographic Information Systems course. The aim of this project is to represent the susceptibility map 
of an assigned area, given as input data some environmental factors. It was also required to compute an indicator of landslide hazard exposure, since a population map 
was also provided. Group areas have been identified by the tutors. Each area represents a watershed having an extension 45 square kilometer resident population 1000 
inhabitants and at least one recorded landslide event within its boundary. All the data provided have been preprocessed and prepared for the analysis by the group.
